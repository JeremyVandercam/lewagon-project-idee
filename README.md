LoL is an online, 5 vs. 5 competitive PC game. It is one of - if not the most - popular game currently around. Despite that LoL has surprisingly little mainstream coverage, which is most likely due to its complexity - itâ€™s not an easy game to understand.

LoL has a professional league. The top prize for the best team is over five million dollars and the average player makes a six-figure income. This data set aggregates basic statistics for every game since 2015 across all the professional leagues other than China.
